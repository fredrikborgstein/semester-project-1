              natural world. Kids and families can engage in planting their own
              seeds, observing their growth over time, and even taking home
              their creations. This part of the exhibit emphasizes the
              importance of nurturing plants and understanding the cycles that

              like the fearsome Velociraptor, that used sharp teeth and claws to
              hunt their prey. Then discover the gentle herbivores, such as the
